- Madagascar is the 5Ô∏è‚É£th poorest country globally and faces terrific consequences due to climate change.
- With multiple parties promising to provide reforestation services comes the fact that planting trees is simple, but making sure they will grow is more complex. 
- For the moment, B√¥ndy monitors trees physically, but this is not a scalable model. 
- Together with the Omdena, a solution to combine satellite and drone imagery, meterological data, and Machine Learning a dashboard was developed to monitor plants.
